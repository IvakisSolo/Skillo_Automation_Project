Welcome to my personal project for the course QA Automation Engineer in Skillo. 
In this project there is a Test Suite containing 5 Tests that operate on the iSkillo platform. The project is based on TestNG and Selenium WebDriver technologies and is organised using Page Object Modeling and PageFactory. 

The tests include: 
1. Registering a new user on the platform; 
2. Successful log in and out of an existing user; 
3. Creating a new post by uploading a picture and adding a caption to it; 
4. Deleting an already existing post; 
5. Liking the first post on the home page;

This suite also contains the option if a test fails to save a screenshot and a testng.xml that allows it to be executed using Maven commands. It works using Google Chrome browser.
